In April 2025, I visited Dr. Helena Knowles' lab (the Coherent Quantum Lab) at the University of Cambridge, as part of the M4QN Lab Exchange Award I was given. I had a wonderful time in Cambridge and was inspired by the exciting researches in the Cavendish Laboratory. During the visit, we explored the use of photonic integrated circuits for biological quantum sensing with NV centres. Our successful initial tests suggest this new platform could be a game changer for NV-based biosensing. Stay tuned for more!
