At National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Taiwan, we developed the worldâ€™s smallest photonic quantum computer! During a press conference on October 16, 2024, our research from my master's work was highlighted, featuring our innovative photonic quantum computing architecture that encodes information in 32 dimensions within a single photon's time bins. This breakthrough allowed us to implement Shor's algorithm on a single photon, demonstrating the potential of our method for large scale photonic quantum computing. Our findings, published in [Physical Review Applied](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.22.034003), mark a significant step in enhancing computational power for photonic-based quantum computing.
