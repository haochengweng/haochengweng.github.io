title: "Nitrogen-vacancy centres integrated with foundry silicon nitride photonics"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/CLEO_EU
excerpt: 'Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond show great promise for quantum computing, where photonic entanglement can be generated using long-lived optically-active spins. A quantum processor would require a large number of interconnected NV centres, and an integrated platform becomes necessary for control and routing. Benefits of integration include nanophotonic cavities with ultra-small mode volumes, multi-layer electronics, and use of existing integrated quantum photonic components and architectures. Pick-and-place methods have been adopted to combine diamond microchiplets with aluminium nitride. Photonic and spin properties has also been measured in nanodiamond encapsulated in optimised silicon nitride (SiNx). However, challenges remain to interface diamond with photonics in a scalable and manufacturable process. In particular, the need to identify and manipulate stochastically located emitters requires precise and time-intensive confocal microscopy...'

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond show great promise for quantum computing, where photonic entanglement can be generated using long-lived optically-active spins. A quantum processor would require a large number of interconnected NV centres, and an integrated platform becomes necessary for control and routing.
