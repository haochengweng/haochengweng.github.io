Informational contributions to thermodynamics can be studied in isolation by considering systems with fully-degenerate Hamiltonians. In this regime, being in non-equilibrium -- termed informational non-equilibrium -- provides thermodynamic resources, such as extractable work, solely from the information content. The usefulness of informational non-equilibrium creates an incentive to obtain more of it, motivating the question of how to concentrate it: can we increase the local informational non-equilibrium of a product state  under a global closed system (unitary) evolution? We fully solve this problem analytically, showing that it is impossible for two-qubits, and it is always possible to find states achieving this in higher dimensions. The notion of bound resources in this framework is then discussed, along with initial global correlations ability to activate concentration. Finally, we apply our results to study the concentration of purity and intrinsic randomness.
