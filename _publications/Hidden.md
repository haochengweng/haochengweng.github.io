The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) distinguishes nonmacrorealistic channels from macrorealistic ones by constraining the experimental outcomes of the underlying system. In this work, we propose a class of channels which, initially, cannot violate the LGI (in the form of the temporal Bell inequality) but can violate it after the application of stochastic pre- and post-operations (SPPOs). As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the stochastic pre- and post-operations in an amplitude-damping channel with photonic qubits. We denote the above phenomenon as hidden nonmacrorealistic channels. We also discuss the relationship between these hidden nonmacrorealistic channels [in terms of the temporal Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality] and the strongly nonlocality-breaking channel, which breaks the hidden spatial CHSH nonlocality for arbitrary states. In general, if the channel satisfies hidden nonmacrorealism, it is not a strongly CHSH nonlocality-breaking channel.
