Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres are exceptional solid-state quantum sensors with optically addressable spins. With room-temperature operability and biocompatibility, functionalised NV centres in nanodiamonds facilitate atomic-scale tracking and real-time monitoring of physical and chemical properties within living systems [1]. Conventionally, these systems work by addressing stochastically-positioned defects with a complex bulk-optic microscope [2] or using a single scanning probe, limited in scalability and the ability to capture spatial and temporal information simultaneously.
