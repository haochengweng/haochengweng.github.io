I am an experimentalist interested in quantum physics, with a focus on developing quantum technologies to address real-world problems. Despite being a hundred-year-old theory, quantum physics continues to be actively studied for its intriguing properties and its elegant description of the microscopic world. By applying first-principles thinking, one can transform foundational quantum experiments into revolutionary technologies, impacting fields such as life science, materials science, computing, and communication.

I completed my B.S. in Physics from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in 2019, where I conducted research on temporal quantum correlations and developed a quantum-random-walk search algorithm for superconducting quantum systems. During my M.S., also at NTHU, I joined Professor Chih-Sung Chuu's lab, focusing on quantum foundations and implementing quantum computation algorithms using single-photon experiments. In 2022, I began my Ph.D. at the University of Bristol and Quantum Engineering Technology Labs (QET Labs), where I am working on color center defects in diamonds to develop integrated photonic and electronic platforms for large-scale quantum applications involving solid-state spin-photonic interfaces.
